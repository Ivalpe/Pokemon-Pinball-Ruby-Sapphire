 Description

This is a recreation of one of the Pokémon pinball games, specifically Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire.

The difference between our project and the original game is the way of scoring, the Pikachu that in the original game you have to charge to save you, and the objective, which in the original is to capture Pokémon.

How to Play

To play, simply use the left and right arrow keys to control the flippers, bouncing the ball around the playfield to hit targets, complete challenges, and rack up points. The goal is to score as high as possible before losing all your balls. Use the down arrow key to activate the spring and launch the ball. If you’re able to hit certain targets or complete objectives, you may earn bonus balls to keep the game going. If you lose all your balls, the game ends, and you can try again to beat your high score.
